### Updates to the transactions list component

This update brings some improvements to the component that displays lists of transactions on the homepage and on the
transactions page. Previously you were only able to see a limited number of transactions from the mempool in either
view. Now you are able to see all items currently pending, paginate through them, and filter between types of
transactions. This update also changes the way we are filtering transactions: previously there was a naive
implementation that simply filtered through the data returned. This meant that if the limit was set to 50, and all 50 of
the returned items were of one type, filtering to view others would remove all transactions from view. Now the data is
re-fetched with the selected types. This gives a much better experience, allowing users to see all available
transactions of a given set of types.

### Function summaries on pending Contract Call transactions

We had previously been reliant on some data that was only available after a transaction was confirmed. The component
that displays the function summary of a contract-call transaction has been refactored to use only the data that is
available before and after confirmation. This is useful when doing many calls to the same function with different
arguments passed -- previously it would have been hard to keep track of which contract-call transaction had which
arguments.

### Other fixes

- When viewing a `stack-stx` function call transaction, the `pox-addr` parameter is now parsed and rendered as the BTC
  address it represents.
- Fixed a bug where the transaction list component would display "Load more transactions" when in-fact there were no
  more transaction to load.
- Added Fathom tracking.
- Fixed bug around logging into the sandbox with the Stacks Wallet extension.
- Fixed bug where stale data would persist in the transactions list of an address page when navigating to another
  address page.
- Added this changelog page
