## Transactions on contract-deploy pages

In the Stacks Blockchain, contracts are able to be participants in transactions. This is typically in the form of being
the contract that is called for a function call transaction. This PR adds the list of transactions for any contract
deploy transaction, giving the user the ability to see all calls to said contract. You will also be able to see any
pending transaction related to a given contract. You can see
an [example here](https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/0x41356e380d164c5233dd9388799a5508aae929ee1a7e6ea0c18f5359ce7b8c33?chain=mainnet), 
with the PoX contract.

## Contract balances

In the same way that contracts are able to participate in transactions, they can also hold balances of STX, NFTs, and
FTs. This PR implements the same balance card component that a user would see if they were on any other address page.

### Other fixes

- Fixed bugs / removed race conditions related to network switching.
- Fixed a bug where links to testnet data would not render the correct open graph data.
- The blocks list on the homepage now uses `react-query` just as the transaction lists do.
- If there are no pending transactions, the transactions list view will default to confirmed transactions.
